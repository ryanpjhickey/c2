challenge 2

# First I used the Horiseon website from challenge 1 as a starting template. I edited the page to the extent where I have a WIP layout that I still would like to improve. I was able to create buttons at the top that direct you to the correct place but I don't have all of the sections created yet. I plan to work on this more but I have not had time this week because I have been traveling! I played around with background sizing and borders for each new heading.
